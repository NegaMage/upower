This function takes an ASM instruction as input. Ex: 'add $t1, $t0, $t2'

And it returns the mnemonic (the instruction type- label, assembler directive) the input operands, the output operands and other misc information
about the ASM instruction.
It also outputs the return value of the parseLine() function.
